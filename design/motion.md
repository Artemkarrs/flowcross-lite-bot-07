# Motion Guidelines

- Durations: 200–300 ms for hover/press/segmented switches
- Easing: ease-out for entrances, ease-in-out for state changes
- Entrance: fade + 6px translateY (0.25 s)
- Press: scale to 0.98 (0.1–0.15 s), rebound 0.2 s
- Modal: 250 ms dissolve/smart animate, slight scale (0.98→1)
- Avoid neon/glow; keep shadows subtle
